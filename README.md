## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/L1K3D/android-studio-calculator.git
   cd android-studio-calculator
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the application:**
   - For Android:
     ```bash
     npx react-native run-android
     ```
   - For Expo:
     ```bash
     npx expo start
     ```

## Usage

Upon launching the application, users are presented with a digital calculator interface. The buttons are clearly labeled, and the display provides instant feedback for any entered operation. The calculator supports both integer and floating-point numbers.

### Example Operations

- **Addition:** `12 + 8 = 20`
- **Multiplication:** `7 × 5 = 35`
- **Division:** `40 ÷ 8 = 5`
- **Chained Calculations:** Users can perform continuous calculations without resetting the input.

## Customization and Extensibility

Developers can easily add new functionalities or modify the UI by editing `App.js`. The structure allows for the integration of additional mathematical functions or UI enhancements.
